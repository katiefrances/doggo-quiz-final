# doggo-quiz-final
## Final version of the doggo quiz

This was a quiz created with [@rhyswoodberry](https://www.github.com/rhyswoodberry) for our Coder Academy Terminal App assignment in which we had a 2 day deadline. We had a great time developing it, and learnt a lot about Ruby as well as the terminal itself.
